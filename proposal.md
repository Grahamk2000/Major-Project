# Graham Kelly's Proposal

## I am planning on making many arcade style games such as snake, pong, flappy bird, minesweeper, brick breaker etc. and combining them together with a great menu to select different games

## Must Have's

* multiple games
* menu to select games
* many different forms of collision detection
* cheat modes to make trouble shooting easier


## Nice To Have

* awesome graphics 
* sounds
* different versions of each game/ difficulties
